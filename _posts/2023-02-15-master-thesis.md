## Abstract
Silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) have been widely used in medical, food, and technological materials. Therefore, frequent and chronic exposure AgNPs in daily life is possible which might lead to hazards to human health. It has been known that AgNPs cause oxidative stress, genetic toxicity, mitochondrial dysfunction, and neurotoxicity which are the risk factors of Alzheimer's disease. This study aims to investigate whether chronic AgNPs exposure causes Aβ toxicity and its underlying mechanisms in *Caenorhabditis elegans*. Firstly, the results showed that AgNPs at 1 mg/L and the released ion Ag+ 0.01 mg/L did not significantly affect the growth of both *C. elegans* food source *Escherichia coli* OP50 and *C. elegans* and therefore the concentrations were selected as the highest exposure concentrations in subsequent investigation. Furthermore, the transgenic strain CL2006, which expresses human Aβ₁₋₄₂ under the control of a muscle-specific promoter, was used to test effects of the paralysis assay by chronic AgNPs exposure. The results showed that 1 mg/L AgNPs was the most effective concentration to cause paralysis which was not due to Ag+. In addition, chronic AgNPs exposure elevated Aβ accumulation and ROS level. In addition, the elevated Aβ toxicity by chronic AgNPs exposure is associated with the transcription factor DAF-16. Moreover, the normal linear mitochondrial morphology was significantly reduced while the fragmented mitochondrial morphology was increased upon chronic AgNPs exposure. RNA interference assays were conducted to knockdown the genes in mitochondrial complex. The results showed that *gas-1* (mitochondrial complex I) and *mev-1* (mitochondrial complex II) were associated with the Aβ toxicity induced by AgNPs chronic exposure. Taken together, this study suggests that chronic AgNPs exposure results in Aβ toxicity which is associated with mitochondrial dysfunction and an increased oxidative stress related with DAF-16 and mitochondrial complex genes *gas-1* and *mev-1*. This study suggests chronic AgNPs exposure might lead to potential harzard of Alzheimer's disease.
